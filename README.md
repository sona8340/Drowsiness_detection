# Real-time Drowsiness Detection System
## Description: 
Developed a real-time drowsiness detection system using computer vision and facial landmarks. The system monitors eye aspect ratios (EAR) to identify signs of drowsiness and issues visual alerts when detected. Potential applications in driver safety and industrial settings. Technologies used: Python, OpenCV, dlib.

## Key Achievements:

Real-time monitoring of EAR for drowsiness detection.

Visual alerts and notifications to enhance alertness.

Potential safety enhancement in transportation and industrial sectors.
